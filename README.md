- Create a repository on GitHub (https://github.com/new) and clone it locally
- `npm init` (will create the package.json)
- When asked use 'src/index.js' as entry point
- Install the neutrino dev dependencies: `npm i -D neutrino @neutrinojs/web`
- Inside your project folder, create a folder called `src` with a `index.js` inside it
- Edit the `package.json` file and add the `start` and `build` scripts like
  ```
  "build": "neutrino build --use @neutrinojs/web",
  "start": "neutrino start --use @neutrinojs/web",
  ```
- Run the server with `npm run start` (or actually just `npm start`)
- Check that everything went smoothly in your browser
- Stop the server (`CTRL+C`)
- Install jQuery with `npm i jquery` (no `-D` because it is not a development dependency)
- In your `src/index.js` import jQuery like:
  `import $ from 'jquery';`
- Restart the server (you know how to do it)
- Add something like:
  ```js
  $(() => {
    $('body').append('<h1>Hello World!</h1>');
  });
  ```
  and look at your browser if the text appears in the body
- Create a `styles.css` (inside the `src` folder) with body background-color whatever
- Add your CSS file by using `import './styles.css';`
- Look at your browser ;) (fancy.. hueeee)

## Linting your code and use Neutrino configuration file

- Linting is your friend! It will help you keeping pretty code and enforce best practices.
  add the `@neutrinojs/airbnb-base` (as dev dependency) with
  `npm i -D @neutrinojs/airbnb-base`
- Remove the `--use @neutrinojs/web` from your `package.json`
- Create a file called `.neutrinorc.js` at the root of your project with the following content:
  ```js
  module.exports = {
    use: [
      ['@neutrinojs/airbnb-base'], // first the linting!
      ['@neutrinojs/web'], // then the compilation
    ],
  };
  ```
- If you have linting errors, read them carefully (they always mention in which file and at which line the error occurs) and if you still don't understand them make a search (eslint name-of-the-error)
- Linting can also be a pain in the keyboard.  
  Luckily they are ways to disable it where it annoys (but! try to avoid that... please)
  - `/* eslint-disable */` and `/* eslint-enable */`
  - `// eslint-disable-next-line` or `// eslint-disable-line`
  You can also do this for one rule like `// eslint-disable-next-line no-console` (`no-console` is the name of the only rule to be turned off for the next line)

## Configure the Neutrino presets

- Now, in your browser, have a look at the `<title>` tag of the `<head>`, it should be something like `Webpack App` and this is not great.  
  Instead you want to have something like `My App` and to do so you can change a bit your `.neutrinorc.js` file the following way:
  ```js
  module.exports = {
    use: [
      ['@neutrinojs/airbnb-base'],
      [
        '@neutrinojs/web',
        {
          html: {
            title: 'My App'
          }
        }
      ],
    ]
  };
  ```
  In order to find additional configuration you will have to
  **R**ead **T**he **F**ine **M**anual (starting at https://neutrino.js.org/presets/@neutrinojs/web/ )

<details><summary>Advanced HTML template</summary>


If you need to customize the HTML even further, you may want to find the template which used by Neutrino / Webpack to render the index.html
  It took me a bit of time but after following the white rabbit.
  I first looked at the `@neutrinojs/html-template` (which was mentioned in the docs of the `@neutrinojs/web`).  
  This lead me to the `html-webpack-template` module and I found the 
  template here: https://github.com/jaketrent/html-webpack-template/blob/master/index.ejs
- Copy the `.ejs` file in your `src` directory (rename it if you want, I did it and called it `html.template.ejs`)
- In your `.neutrinorc.js` file, change the settings to make them look like:
  ```js
  const path = require('path');

  module.exports = {
    use: [
      ['@neutrinojs/airbnb-base'],
      [
        '@neutrinojs/web',
        {
          html: {
            template: path.join(__dirname, 'src/html.template.ejs'),
            title: 'My App',
          }
        }
      ],
    ]
  };
  ```
- Make changes in the template (be careful with what you change though)
- Restart your server

## Adding Bootstrap and SASS loader

- Inorder to load and compile SASS file you will need to install the `node-sass` and `sass-loader` as development dependency as follow: `npm i -D node-sass sass-loader`
- Then add bootstrap 4 (at the time of writting this tutorial it is still in beta and therefore needs the `@next`) using the following command: `npm i popper.js bootstrap@next`
- Add the styles loader to your `.neutrinorc.js`
  (as described in ):
  ```js
    module.exports = {
    use: [
      ['@neutrinojs/airbnb-base'],
      [
        '@neutrinojs/web',
        {
          style: {
            loaders: [
              {
                loader: 'sass-loader',
              }
            ]
          },
          html: {
            title: 'My App'
          }
        }
      ],
    ]
  };
  ```
- In your `src/index.js` 
  change `import 'styles.css';` to `import 'styles.scss';` and rename your style file accordingly

## Loading HTML templates

- Create a folder called `templates` in your `src` directory
- Inside the `templates` folder, add a file `navbar.html`
- Import the template in the `src/index.js` as follow
  ```js
  import navbar from './templates/navbar.html';
  ```
- Add the `navbar` to the `#root` as follow:
  ```js
  $('#root').append(navbar);
  ```

**Note:** If you want to link a resource (which is located in the `src/static` directory) from a template HTML file you need to use the relative path from the template to the resource.  
For example you want to add an image:
```html
<img src="./../static/kitten.jpg" alt="Cute furry animal" />
```

# Exercise

In order to complete the exercise you should look at the Bootstrap documentation for
- The carousel component
- The flex utilities
- The sizing utilities

**Important:** you can ask **1** question, so choose wisely what your question to the teacher will be and if you are stuck: __breath in, breath out__.

## Navbar

- Must use the dark theme
- 2 menu points, the last one being active

## Custom carousel component

- Add a carousel component with a height of half the height of the viewport but not less than 200px
- The carousel must have 4 slides
- Each slide must be split in 2 equally wide blocks
  - 1 block with:
    - A title
    - A short text
    - A button
    - It must have a background color
    - Use the full height
    - A padding equivalent to the half of grid gutter width bootstrap variable
  - 1 block with an image which keeps its original proportions
- The first and third slides must have the text block on the left and their texts aligned on the right
- The second and fourth slide must have the text block on the right and their texts aligned on the left
- The indicators must be circles of 15px radius and use the bootstrap primary color
